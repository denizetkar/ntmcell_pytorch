# PyTorch Neural Turing Machine (NTM)

PyTorch implementation of [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401) (NTM) in a way similar to [LSTMCell](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTMCell).

This repository does not include any training examples. It only includes a simple comparison between **torch.nn.LSTMCell** and **NTMCell** implemented here.

Much of the code used here is inspired by [this](https://github.com/loudinthecloud/pytorch-ntm) repository.
